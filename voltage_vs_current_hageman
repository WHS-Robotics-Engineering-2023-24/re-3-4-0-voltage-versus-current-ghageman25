In Circuit Simulator I built two circuits. One had a 6V source, and one had a 3V source. Both had a 100 ohm resistor, a diode, and a ground wire.
Voltage and current are related to each other, and current can't be made without voltage. Voltage is te power that allows electrons to flow, creating current. 
When there's more voltage, there's more current. When there's more resistance, there's less current.
